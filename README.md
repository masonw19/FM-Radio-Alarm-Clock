## About
### Alarm Clock
The alarm clock is operated with three buttons. Button 1 on the schematic is used to increment the the time variables (minute, hour, day, am/pm) for either setting the
time or the alarm. Button 2 in the schematic is used to iterate through the time variable we will increment with Button 1. If we have Button 3 
pressed down and we click Button 1, we will be able to change between the alarm and the time screens. Button 3 can also be clicked to stop the alarm
once it has started. 

I have used a counter in the Arduino and calculated the value we need to count up to with its internal clock so that we can trigger an overflow interrupt
every second to keep track of the time.

If you turn off the clock you will have to manually set the time and alarm the next time you turn it back on. 

### FM Radio
The variable capacitor in parallel with a inductor forms a tank circuit which produces electrical oscillations. The way that this circuit works is by
first charging up the capacitor and then discharging it to charge the inductor. As current flows in the inductor, the inductor creates a magnetic
field. When the magnetic field breaks down the inductor will release its stored energy and now the opposite side of the capacitor will become charged. 
This capacitor then discharges and the inductor will again create a magnetic field which will break down and release its energy to charge the
originally charged side of the capacitor. This process will continue to create oscillations at a certain frequency. The purpose of using a variable
capacitor is so that the user can tune the frequency generated by the tank circuit so that they can listen to different radio stations.
