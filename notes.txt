oscillator is an amplifier which uses positive feedback that generates an output frequency
without the use of an input signal

characteristics of an oscillator:
1. some form of amplification
2. positive feedback
3. a frequency determine feedback network

for oscillations, the loop gain must be unity else the output signal will not be periodic

DC supply energy is converted by the oscillator into AC energy at the required freq.

LC oscillator frequency is controlled by using a tuned or resonant LC circuit

At high frequencies cap acts like short circ and inductor acts as open circ
At low frequencies cap acts like open circ and inductor acts as short circ
Between these extremes the LC combination produces a 'resonant' circuit that has a resonant freq.
At resonance the cap and the inductor cancel each other leaving no phase shift

resonant frequency = 1 / [(2pi) * sqrt(LC)]
	if L or C decrease, the frequency will increase

To keep oscillations going we need to replace the energy lost in each oscillation.
Simple way of replacaing lost energy is to take part of the output from the LC circ and 
amplify it and then feed it back inot the LC circuit.
This process can be achieved using a voltage amplifier by an op amp, FET or BJT
gain of amplifier must be 1 so that the freq of LC circ stays constant

If we use th BJT for the gain then the voltage will be 180 degrees out of phase. To 
maintain oscillations the input voltage must be in phase so we need another 180 degrees 
shift.
